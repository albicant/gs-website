My name is Gennady V. Sytov. I am a Software Engineer in the Chicago, IL area. I have recently graduated with a B.Sc in Computer Science (Minor in Mathematics) from [ Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.pdx.edu/cecs/home) at [Portland State University](https://www.pdx.edu/). I graduated with highest honors with a GPA of 3.93 [*summa cum laude*](https://www.pdx.edu/commencement/order-cap-gown-regalia). I am interested in learning more about applied mathematics and computational finance.

My favorite programming languages are C++ for it's logic and popularity in the scientific community, Java for it's object oriented focus and Python for it's readbility and ease of use. My hobbies include classic cars from the 1930's and menswear.
