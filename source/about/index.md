My name is Gennady V. Sytov ([pronounce it](https://www.name-coach.com/gennadii-sytov)). I am a Software Engineer in the Chicago, IL area. I have recently graduated with a B.Sc in Computer Science (Minor in Mathematics) from [ Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.pdx.edu/cecs/home) at [Portland State University](https://www.pdx.edu/). I graduated [*summa cum laude*](https://www.pdx.edu/commencement/order-cap-gown-regalia) with a 3.93 GPA. I am interested in learning more about applied mathematics and computational finance.

My favorite programming languages are C++ for its logic and popularity in the scientific community, Java for its object oriented focus and Python for its readbility and ease of use. My hobbies include [classic cars from the 1930's](https://digitalcollections.detroitpubliclibrary.org/islandora/object/islandora%3A153397) and [Art Deco style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Deco) architecture & fashion. Once the pandemic subsides, I am hoping to go [fishing](https://www.ifishillinois.org/) and learn [tap dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAB12aeI6nA).

This website design is based on the [Cactus](https://probberechts.github.io/hexo-theme-cactus/) theme using the [Hexo blogging framework](https://hexo.io/).
