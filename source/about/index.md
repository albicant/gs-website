My name is Gennady V. Sytov ([pronounce it](https://www.name-coach.com/gennadii-sytov)). I’m a senior backend software engineer in the Chicago, IL area with 5+ years of experience building and operating high-traffic, distributed services.

At [Ahold Delhaize USA](https://www.adusa.com/), I work on a multi-brand e-commerce platform supporting millions of customers. My core focus has been authentication and session-critical systems: designing and owning services that handle customer login/session lifecycle end-to-end (JWT, MFA, remember-me cookies, session exit) in high-concurrency environments. I care a lot about reliability, safe deployments, and pragmatic engineering—shipping changes with strong automated test coverage and low production incident/rollback rates.

I’m most comfortable in the JVM ecosystem (Java and Kotlin) and enjoy working on systems involving API design, caching, data consistency tradeoffs, and operational maturity. I’m also happy to pick up other backend languages and stacks when needed.

I earned my B.S. in Computer Science (Math Minor) from [Portland State University](https://www.pdx.edu/), graduating [*summa cum laude*](https://www.pdx.edu/commencement/order-cap-gown-regalia) (3.93 GPA).

In my free time, I like reading about [classic cars from the 1930s](https://digitalcollections.detroitpubliclibrary.org/islandora/object/islandora%3A153397) and [Art Deco-era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Deco) architecture & fashion.

This website design is based on the [Cactus](https://probberechts.github.io/hexo-theme-cactus/) theme using the [Hexo blogging framework](https://hexo.io/).
