### Background
At the beginning of the [Capstone: Perception](/2019/12/12/Capstone-Perception-CEA-608-Closed-Captioning-Encoder/) project, I was tasked with coming up with an initial [wireframe prototype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe) for our project. I am not a [UI design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface_design) person, so this was a big challenge for me. Furthermore, I was also very busy at the time, as I was working in parallel on my [GSoC project](/2019/09/05/GSoC-2019-CGAL-Shape-Regularization/). 

### Problem and Solution
I researched some basic wireframing software programs in order to figure out how to best go about this task. However, I found many of these programs ill-suited for our needs or clunky to work with. As a dyed-in-the-wool math person, I got the idea to create the wireframe a using a [spreadsheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet). The only other alternative was to physically hand draw the UI, and well, I’m not much of an artist. Here is what I came up with:

### Outcome
The resulting spreadsheet wireframe design ended up being warmly received by my [teammates](https://github.com/capstone-team-a/Perception#contributors) and our sponsor ([AWS Elemental](https://www.elemental.com/)). The humble spreadsheet provided all the details we needed to brainstorm around going forward with the project. 

### More About the Project
In the end, I was assigned to the back end team for the project and not the UI/front end team, but nevertheless, it was an interesting experience to show how a math person can “think outside the box” by using familiar tools to solve a UI problem.
