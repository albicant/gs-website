I participated in 2019 [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) by creating the [Shape regularization](https://cgal.geometryfactory.com/~danston/Shape_regularization/index.html) package for the [Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL)](https://www.cgal.org/) project by implementing the Generalized Global Regularization algorithm from the article ["KIPPI: Kinetic Polygonal Partitioning of Images"](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01740958/file/kippi.pdf) written by Jean-Philippe Bauchet and Florent Lafarge at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en). Development for the package for CGAL was carried out under the supervision of [Dr. Dmitry Anisimov](https://www.anisimovdmitry.com/). The package comes with classes that work on a given set of 2D segments.

[Google Summer of Code 2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) was a 12 week, full time, remote, paid internship with regular evaluation of the participant's work every 4 weeks. I designed, implemented, tested and documented the package under the direction of my mentor [Dr. Dmitry Anisimov](https://www.anisimovdmitry.com/). 

Technologies used: [C++11](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/11), [git](https://git-scm.com/), [CMake](https://cmake.org/), [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/), [OSQP solver](https://osqp.org/docs/).
Concepts used: [Object-Oriented Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_design), [Generic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming), [Quadratic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_programming).
